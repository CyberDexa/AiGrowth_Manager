- **Day 3**: Database updates (scheduled_posts table)
- **Day 4**: Real publishing tests
- **Day 5**: Scheduled publishing tests
- **Day 6**: Frontend integration
- **Day 7**: Testing & documentation

### Why Today Matters

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Time Management
- Set 1-hour timer for each platform
- Take 15-min break between platforms
- Don't rush - accuracy over speed

### Organization
- Keep credentials template open
- Copy credentials immediately when obtained
- Update progress tracker in real-time

### When Stuck
1. Check DAY_1_QUICK_START.md troubleshooting section
2. Search platform's documentation
3. Screenshot the error and note it in progress tracker
4. Move to next platform, come back later

### Energy Management
- Hardest platform first (LinkedIn - requires company page)
- Easiest in middle (Meta - straightforward)
- Most important last (Twitter - Elevated Access critical)

Actually, recommended order:
1. **Meta first** (easiest, builds confidence)
2. **Twitter second** (get Elevated Access request in ASAP)
3. **LinkedIn last** (most complex, but fresh from earlier experience)
