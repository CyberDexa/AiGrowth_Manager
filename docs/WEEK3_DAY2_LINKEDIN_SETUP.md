### 2.2 Add Products (CRITICAL!)

2. Request access to **"Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect"**
   - Click **"Request access"**
   - Fill out the form explaining your use case
   
3. Request access to **"Share on LinkedIn"**

   - Only needed for analytics and ads
   - Can be added later

**Use Case Description for "Share on LinkedIn":**
```
AI Growth Manager is a multi-tenant SaaS platform that provides social media 
management services to multiple business customers. Our platform enables 
different companies and entrepreneurs to manage their LinkedIn presence 
through a centralized dashboard.

PLATFORM NATURE:
- Multi-tenant application serving multiple independent businesses
- Each business connects their own LinkedIn account via OAuth
- Businesses manage their own content and posting schedule
- No cross-tenant data sharing or access

KEY FEATURES:
- OAuth 2.0 authentication for each business's LinkedIn account
- Allow authenticated users to create and publish posts to their LinkedIn
- Schedule posts for future publication to user's own timeline
- Retrieve authenticated user's profile information
- Display basic post analytics for user's published content

USER BENEFIT:
- AI-assisted content creation for multiple business customers
- Consistent posting schedule management
- Better engagement through optimized timing
- Centralized multi-platform social media management

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- OAuth 2.0 for secure per-user authentication
- UGC Posts API for publishing user-generated content
- Each business authorizes their own LinkedIn account
- Profile API for retrieving member information
- Strict privacy standards - no data mining, sharing, or selling
- Data isolation between different business tenants

IMPORTANT:
All actions are explicitly initiated by authenticated users managing their own 
business accounts. We do not perform any automated, bulk, or cross-tenant 
actions. Each business has full control over their LinkedIn integration.
```

### 2.3 Wait for Product Approval
- **"Sign In with LinkedIn"** - Usually approved instantly ‚úÖ
- **"Share on LinkedIn"** - May take 24 hours (sometimes instant)
- You'll receive email notifications when approved

---

## Step 3: Configure OAuth 2.0 Settings

### 3.1 Set Up OAuth Redirect URLs

1. Go to the **"Auth"** tab
2. Scroll to **"OAuth 2.0 settings"**
3. Add the following **Redirect URLs** (one per line):

**For Development (using localtunnel):**
```
https://aigrowth.loca.lt/api/oauth/linkedin/callback
```

**For Production (add these later):**
```
https://yourdomain.com/api/oauth/linkedin/callback
https://app.yourdomain.com/api/oauth/linkedin/callback
```

4. Click **"Update"**

### 3.2 Get Your Credentials

In the **"Auth"** tab, you'll find:

1. **Client ID** (visible immediately)
   - Copy this - you'll need it for your `.env` file
   
2. **Client Secret** (click "Show" to reveal)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Copy this immediately and store it securely
   - You won't be able to see it again!

**Example:**
```
Client ID: 78abc1234xyz
Client Secret: A1B2C3D4E5F6G7H8
```

### 3.3 Configure OAuth Scopes

LinkedIn uses scopes to define what your app can access:

**Required Scopes:**
- `openid` - Basic authentication
- `profile` - User profile information
- `email` - User email address
- `w_member_social` - Post to LinkedIn on behalf of user

These are automatically configured when you add the "Share on LinkedIn" product.

---

## Step 4: Update Backend Environment Variables

### 4.1 Add LinkedIn Credentials to .env

Open `backend/.env` and update the LinkedIn section:

```bash
# LinkedIn OAuth Configuration
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
```

### 4.2 Verify Backend OAuth Routes

The backend already has LinkedIn OAuth configured:
- `/api/oauth/linkedin/authorize` - Initiates OAuth flow
- `/api/oauth/linkedin/callback` - Handles OAuth callback
- `/api/oauth/linkedin/connect` - Connects account to business

---

## Step 5: Test the Integration

### 5.1 Ensure Tunnel is Running

If you closed the tunnel from Twitter setup, restart it:

```bash
lt --port 8003 --subdomain aigrowth
```

Your URL: `https://aigrowth.loca.lt`

### 5.2 Update Frontend Environment (if needed)

Ensure `frontend/.env.local` has:

```bash
# For LinkedIn OAuth testing (same as Twitter)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://aigrowth.loca.lt
```

### 5.3 Test OAuth Flow

1. **Start both servers:**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend && ./venv/bin/python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8003
   
   # Frontend
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open browser** to `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Go to Settings** ‚Üí **Social Accounts**

4. **Click "Connect LinkedIn"**

5. **You'll be redirected to LinkedIn** to authorize

6. **Authorize the app**

7. **Redirected back** - LinkedIn account should show as connected! ‚úÖ

## Step 6: Test LinkedIn Posting

### 6.1 Create a Test Post

1. Go to **Content** or **Strategies** section
2. Create a new post
3. Select **LinkedIn** as the platform
4. Write a test post (e.g., "Testing my AI Growth Manager integration! üöÄ")
5. Click **"Publish"**

### 6.2 Verify on LinkedIn

1. Go to your LinkedIn profile
2. Check your posts/activity
3. The test post should appear! ‚úÖ
