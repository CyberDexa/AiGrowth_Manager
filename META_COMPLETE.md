## 📋 What's Left for Meta

Before moving to Twitter, you should still:

1. **Add Facebook Login Product**
   - Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/1868636850413828
   - Find "Facebook Login" → Click "Set Up"
   - This enables OAuth login

2. **Add Instagram Graph API Product**
   - Find "Instagram Graph API" → Click "Set Up"
   - This enables Instagram posting

3. **Configure OAuth Redirect URI**
   - Go to "Facebook Login" → Settings
   - Add: `http://localhost:8000/api/oauth/meta/callback`
   - Click "Save Changes"

4. **Create Test Users** (Optional but recommended)
   - Go to "Roles" → "Test Users"
   - Create 2-3 test users for development
   - Save their credentials

## ⚡ Quick Decision

**Option 1: Complete Meta Setup Now (Recommended - 10 min)**
- Finish adding products and configuring OAuth
- Have Meta 100% ready
- Then move to Twitter

**Option 2: Move to Twitter Now**
- Get Twitter credentials (most time-critical!)
- Come back to finish Meta configuration later

---

## 🐦 Next: Twitter Developer Account

**Why Twitter is critical:**
- Requires "Elevated Access" approval
- Can take 1-2 weeks to approve
- Must apply TODAY to minimize delay

**What you'll get:**
- API Key
- API Secret  
- Bearer Token
- Access Token
- Access Token Secret

**Time needed**: 45-60 minutes

## 🎯 Your Choice

**Would you like to:**

### A) Finish Meta setup first (10 minutes)
```
1. Add Facebook Login product
2. Add Instagram Graph API
3. Configure OAuth callback
4. Then → Twitter
```

### B) Move to Twitter now (45-60 minutes)
```
1. Go to https://developer.twitter.com
2. Apply for developer account
3. Request Elevated Access ⚠️
4. Get 5 credentials
5. Come back to finish Meta later
```

---

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Go to Twitter NOW** because:
1. Elevated Access request is time-critical
2. The sooner you apply, the sooner it's approved
3. You can finish Meta setup anytime
4. Twitter is the biggest blocker for Week 3

Then circle back to complete Meta (adding products) later.
