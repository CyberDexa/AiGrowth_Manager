## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **Social API complexity** - APIs change frequently
   - *Mitigation*: Use Buffer/Hootsuite APIs as backup
2. **AI cost overruns** - OpenAI usage could be expensive
   - *Mitigation*: Implement caching, rate limits, quotas
3. **Content quality** - AI might generate poor content
   - *Mitigation*: Extensive prompt engineering + user editing
4. **Timeline slippage** - Solo dev with limited time
   - *Mitigation*: Weekly reviews, cut features aggressively

---

## 🔄 Iteration Strategy

### After Beta Launch (Week 15+)
Based on user feedback, prioritize:

1. **Most requested features** (user voting)
2. **Revenue-impacting improvements** (conversion, retention)
3. **Critical bugs** (anything blocking usage)
4. **Performance issues** (slow load times, errors)

### Post-MVP Features (Backlog)
