## 🎓 Sample Application Answers

### Use Case Description
```
I'm building an AI-powered social media management tool that helps businesses 
create and schedule content across multiple platforms. The tool uses AI to 
generate posts, optimize timing, and track engagement. I need API access to:

1. Post tweets on behalf of authenticated users
2. Upload media (images) with tweets  
3. Schedule tweets for future publication
4. Retrieve basic profile information

This is a self-hosted application for business owners to manage their social 
media presence efficiently.
```

### Tweet/Retweet/Like/Follow Question
```
Yes, primarily Tweet functionality:

TWEET CREATION:
- Allow users to compose and publish tweets
- Upload images to accompany tweets
- Schedule tweets for future publication

The app will NOT:
- Automatically retweet content
- Auto-like tweets
- Auto-follow users
- Send automated Direct Messages
- Perform any bulk actions

All actions are explicitly initiated by the authenticated user through the 
application interface.
```

### Data Analysis Question
```
No extensive analysis. Limited to:

1. Basic engagement metrics (likes, retweets, replies) for posts published 
   through the app to help users understand content performance
2. No analysis of other users' data
3. No sentiment analysis of public tweets
4. No trend analysis or data mining
5. No selling or sharing of any Twitter data

The focus is on content creation and publishing, not data analysis.
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Security
- ✅ Never commit credentials to git
- ✅ `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Use `.env.example` as template
- ✅ Store credentials in password manager
- ✅ Backend encrypts tokens before database storage

### Rate Limits (Elevated Access)
- 50,000 tweets per month (write)
- ~1,600 tweets per day
- 2,000,000 tweet reads per month
- 900 user lookups per 15 minutes

### OAuth Flow
```
User clicks "Connect Twitter"
    ↓
Frontend → Backend /api/oauth/twitter/authorize
    ↓
Redirect to Twitter OAuth
    ↓
User authorizes app
    ↓
Twitter redirects to /api/oauth/twitter/callback
    ↓
Backend exchanges code for tokens
    ↓
Tokens encrypted and stored in database
    ↓
User redirected back to dashboard
    ↓
Twitter account shows as connected
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Callback URL mismatch"

http://localhost:8003/api/oauth/twitter/callback
```

### "Invalid client credentials"
**Problem**: 403 or authentication error  
**Solution**: 
- Check `.env` file for typos
- Ensure no extra spaces
- Verify credentials match Developer Portal
- Restart backend server

### "App not authorized for elevated access"
**Problem**: Can't post tweets  
**Solution**: 
- Wait for Elevated Access approval
- Check email for approval notification
- Verify in Developer Portal dashboard

### "Token expired"
**Problem**: Can't post after some time  
**Solution**:
