## 📝 Session Notes

### Issues Resolved
1. **404 Errors** - Fixed navigation links from `/content` to `/dashboard/content`
2. **Duplicate Layout** - Created shared layout component
3. **Edit Modal** - Implemented full-featured editor

### Decisions Made
1. Use month-grid calendar instead of weekly view
2. Show up to 3 posts per day in calendar
3. Color-code by platform for quick identification
4. Include both library list and calendar views
5. Edit modal instead of inline editing

### Performance Considerations
- Content list loads on business selection
