# Quick Fix for CORS Error - Use Local Backend

## üêõ Problem
Render backend is returning 500 errors, which prevents CORS headers from being sent.
This causes the browser to block requests from localhost:3000.

## ‚úÖ Immediate Solution: Use Local Backend

### Step 1: Start Local Backend

```bash
# In a new terminal window:
cd /Users/olaoluwabayomi/Desktop/growth/solodev/04_MY_PROJECTS/active/ai-growth-manager/backend

# Start the backend on port 8003
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8003
```

Expected output:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8003 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process
INFO:     Started server process
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

### Step 2: Update Frontend Environment

```bash
cd /Users/olaoluwabayomi/Desktop/growth/solodev/04_MY_PROJECTS/active/ai-growth-manager/frontend
```

Edit `.env.local` and change:
```bash
# Change FROM:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://ai-growth-manager.onrender.com

# Change TO:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8003
```

### Step 3: Restart Frontend

In your frontend terminal:
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard/content
2. Should work immediately - no CORS errors!

## üîß Alternative: Wait for Render Deployment

If you prefer to keep using Render:

1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for Render to deploy the CORS fix
2. Check deployment status: https://dashboard.render.com/
3. Once deployed, refresh your app
4. CORS errors should be gone

---

## üìã Render Deployment Status

To check if Render has deployed:

```bash
# Check if the error handler is deployed
curl https://ai-growth-manager.onrender.com/
```

If you see the API version, it's deployed.

## ‚úÖ What I Fixed on Backend

Added a global exception handler that ensures CORS headers are sent even when the backend crashes:

```python
@app.exception_handler(Exception)
async def global_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: Exception):
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=500,
        content={"detail": f"Internal server error: {str(exc)}"},
        headers={
            "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
            "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": "true",
            "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "*",
            "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "*",
        }
    )
```

This ensures CORS headers are always sent, even on 500 errors.

## üí° Recommendation

**For now: Use local backend** - It's faster and you'll avoid these deployment delays.

**Later: Switch back to Render** - Once you're done developing and ready to test production.
