## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Social API complexity | High | Medium | Start with Buffer API as backup |
| AI costs too high | Medium | Low | Implement caching, rate limits |
| Timeline slippage | High | Medium | Weekly reviews, cut features aggressively |
| Solo dev burnout | High | Medium | Realistic hours, weekly breaks |
